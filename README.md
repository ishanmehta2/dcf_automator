The DCF Automator project was one I took on in my time at Vianai Systems this past summer. With the intention of allowing analysts to spend more time on analysis and less on data gathering, the functionality aims
to utilize generative AI and statistical modeling from online sources to build a fully function Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. I have attached an example DCF model as an example of what the code can build on 
any given S&P 500 company. There is also a writeup which explains many of the assumptions made is largely intended for future engineer or analyst use.
